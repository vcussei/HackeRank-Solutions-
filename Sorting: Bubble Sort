The problem was extracted from HackerRank: 

"Given an array of integers, sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm above. Once sorted, print the following three lines:

Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps., where  is the number of swaps that took place.
First Element: firstElement, where  is the first element in the sorted array.
Last Element: lastElement, where  is the last element in the sorted array."

// This is my approach to the question. 
//NOTE: I have uploded my function only. The main function can be optained from: 
//https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-bubble-sort/problem

void countSwaps(int a_count, int* a) {
    int numSwaps = 0; 
    for (int i=0; i<a_count; i++){
        for (int j=0; j<a_count-1; j++){
            if (a[j]>a[j+1]){
                int temp = a[j];
                a[j] =a[j+1];  
                a[j+1]= temp;  
                numSwaps++; 
            }      
        }
    }
  printf("Array is sorted in %d swaps.\n", numSwaps); 
  printf("First Element: %d  \n", a[0]); 
  printf("Last Element: %d ", a[a_count-1]);
